# Metaphy

Metaphy is designed to be an open-source vr metaverse _(here as nexus)_ that supports federated communities, allowing users the freedom of zero censorship _(freedom of expression)_. The only rules, and there for censorship, are defined by the individual community leader(s) that make use of this platform to create their own instances.
